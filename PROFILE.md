# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Bryce Roberts!  

I'm a math student at MIT, expanding my skill set to include software development and AI deployment. I have a strong foundation in mathematical theory and am working on applying it to real-world problems through coding.  

## ðŸ”§ What I'm Learning  
- **Python** for development and AI  
- **AWS Cloud & IaC** for deployment  
- **TypeScript** to broaden my stack 

## ðŸŒ¿ Outside of Tech  
I like **swimming, hiking, bouldering,** and **surfing**â€”basically anything outdoors.
